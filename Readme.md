And add some CSS in a `<style>` block if your README.md supports it:

```
<style>
  blockquote {
    background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #33ccff, #0069cc);
    border-radius: 20px;
    padding: 20px;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-align: center;
  }
</style>
```

Keep in mind that GitHub's Markdown rendering can be limited, so you might need to adjust the styling accordingly.
